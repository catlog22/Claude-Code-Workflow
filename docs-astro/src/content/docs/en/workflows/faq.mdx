# Workflow FAQ

Common questions and answers about CCW workflows.

## General Questions

### What is the difference between Main Workflow and Issue Workflow?

**Main Workflow** is for primary development (Levels 1-5), while **Issue Workflow** is for post-development maintenance.

| Aspect | Main Workflow | Issue Workflow |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| **Purpose** | Feature development | Post-development fixes |
| **Timing** | Development phase | After main workflow completes |
| **Parallelism** | Dependency analysis | Worktree isolation (optional) |

### How do I choose the right workflow level?

### What are Minimum Execution Units?

**Minimum Execution Units** are sets of commands that must execute together as atomic groups. Splitting these commands breaks logical flow and creates incomplete states.

**Example**: The unit `lite-plan -> lite-execute` must complete together. Stopping after `lite-plan` leaves you with a plan but no implementation.

## Level 1 Questions

### When should I use Level 1?

Use Level 1 (`lite-lite-lite`) when:
- Quick fixes (typos, minor adjustments)
- Simple features (single function, small utility)
- Config changes (environment variables, timeout values)
- Documentation updates (readme, comments)

**Don't use** when:
- Multi-module changes
- Need persistent records
- Complex refactoring
- Test-driven development

## Level 2 Questions

### What's the difference between lite-plan, lite-fix, and multi-cli-plan?

| Workflow | Purpose | When to Use |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `lite-plan` | Clear requirements | Single-module features |
| `lite-fix` | Bug diagnosis | Bug fixes, production issues |
| `multi-cli-plan` | Multi-perspective analysis | Technology selection, solution comparison |

### What is hotfix mode?

```bash
/workflow:lite-fix --hotfix "Production database connection failing"
```

**Hotfix mode**:
- Skips most diagnosis phases
- Minimal planning (direct execution)
- Auto-generates follow-up tasks for complete fix + post-mortem
- Use for **production emergencies only**

### When should I use multi-cli-plan vs lite-plan?

Use `multi-cli-plan` when:
- Need multiple perspectives (Gemini, Codex, Claude)
- Technology selection decisions
- Solution comparison
- Architecture trade-offs

Use `lite-plan` when:
- Requirements are clear
- Single-perspective sufficient
- Faster iteration needed

## Level 3 Questions

### What is the difference between plan, tdd-plan, and test-fix-gen?

| Workflow | Purpose | Key Feature |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `plan` | Standard development | 5-phase planning with verification |
| `tdd-plan` | Test-driven development | Red-Green-Refactor cycles |
| `test-fix-gen` | Test fixes | Progressive test layers (L0-L3) |

### What is TDD (Test-Driven Development)?

**TDD** follows the Red-Green-Refactor cycle:

1. **Red**: Write a failing test
2. **Green**: Write minimal code to pass the test
3. **Refactor**: Improve code while keeping tests green

**The Iron Law**:
```
NO PRODUCTION CODE WITHOUT A FAILING TEST FIRST
```

### Why does TDD require tests to be written first?

| Aspect | Test-First | Test-After |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| **Proof** | Tests fail before implementation | Tests pass immediately (proves nothing) |
| **Discovery** | Edge cases found before coding | Edge cases found after coding |
| **Verification** | Verifies requirements | Verifies implementation |

### What are the test layers in test-fix-gen?

| Layer | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **L0** | Static | Type checking, linting |
| **L1** | Unit | Function-level tests |
| **L2** | Integration | Component interaction |
| **L3** | E2E | Full system tests |

## Level 4 Questions

### When should I use brainstorm:auto-parallel?

Use Level 4 (`brainstorm:auto-parallel`) when:
- New feature design
- System architecture refactoring
- Exploratory requirements
- Uncertain implementation approach
- Multi-dimensional trade-offs needed

### What roles are available in brainstorm?

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `system-architect` | System design |
| `ui-designer` | UI design |
| `ux-expert` | User experience |
| `product-manager` | Product requirements |
| `product-owner` | Business value |
| `data-architect` | Data structure |
| `scrum-master` | Process and team |
| `subject-matter-expert` | Domain expertise |
| `test-strategist` | Testing strategy |

### What are With-File workflows?

**With-File workflows** provide documented exploration with multi-CLI collaboration:

| Workflow | Purpose | Level |
|----------|---------|-------|
| `brainstorm-with-file` | Multi-perspective ideation | 4 |
| `debug-with-file` | Hypothesis-driven debugging | 3 |
| `analyze-with-file` | Collaborative analysis | 3 |

## Level 5 Questions

### When should I use ccw-coordinator?

Use Level 5 (`ccw-coordinator`) when:
- Complex multi-step workflows
- Uncertain which commands to use
- Desire end-to-end automation
- Need full state tracking and resumability
- Team collaboration with unified execution flow

### How does ccw-coordinator differ from other levels?

| Aspect | Level 1-4 | Level 5 |
|--------|----------|--------|
| **Command Selection** | Manual | Auto |
| **Orchestration** | Manual | Intelligent |
| **State Tracking** | Varies | Full persistence |

## Execution Questions

### What is lite-execute?

`lite-execute` is the unified execution command for Level 2 workflows:

```bash
/workflow:lite-execute --in-memory
```

**Features**:
- Parallel execution for independent tasks
- Sequential phases for dependent tasks
- Progress tracking via TodoWrite
- Optional code review

### What is execute?

`execute` is the unified execution command for Level 3 workflows:

```bash
/workflow:execute --session WFS-{session-id}
```

**Features**:
- Dependency analysis
- Parallel/sequential task execution
- Session-based progress tracking
- Task completion summaries

## Session Questions

### How do I resume a paused session?

```bash
/workflow:session:resume  # Resume most recent session
/workflow:session:resume WFS-{session-id}  # Resume specific session
```

### How do I complete a session?

```bash
/workflow:session:complete --session WFS-{session-id}
```

This archives the session with lessons learned and updates the manifest.

### How do I list all sessions?

```bash
/workflow:session:list
```

## Artifact Questions

### Where are workflow artifacts stored?

| Level | Artifact Location |
|-------|-------------------|
| Level 1 | None (stateless) |
| Level 2 | `memory://plan` or `.workflow/.lite-fix/`, `.workflow/.multi-cli-plan/` |
| Level 3 | `.workflow/active/WFS-{session}/` |
| Level 4 | `.workflow/active/WFS-{session}/.brainstorming/` |
| Level 5 | `.workflow/.ccw-coordinator/{session}/` |

### What files are in a session?

```
.workflow/active/WFS-{session}/
├── workflow-session.json          # Session metadata
├── IMPL_PLAN.md                   # Implementation plan
├── TODO_LIST.md                   # Progress tracking
├── .task/
│   ├── IMPL-001.json              # Task definitions
│   ├── IMPL-002.json
│   └── ...
└── .process/
    ├── context-package.json       # Project context
    └── planning-notes.md
```

## Testing Questions

### How do I add tests to existing code?

```bash
# Session Mode (from existing session)
/workflow:test-fix-gen WFS-user-auth-v2

# Prompt Mode (direct description)
/workflow:test-fix-gen "Add unit tests for the auth API"
```

### How do I fix failing tests?

```bash
/workflow:test-fix-gen "Tests failing for user registration"
/workflow:test-cycle-execute
```

The workflow will:
1. Analyze test failures
2. Identify root causes
3. Fix issues iteratively
4. Verify >= 95% pass rate

## Troubleshooting

### My workflow failed. What should I do?

1. **Check the error message** - Identify the root cause
2. **Review state.json** - Check `.workflow/.ccw-coordinator/{session}/state.json`
3. **Resume the session** - Use `/workflow:session:resume` to continue
4. **Adjust and retry** - Modify approach based on error

### How do I skip a failing task?

Edit the task JSON to set status to "completed":

```bash
jq '.status = "completed"' .workflow/active/WFS-{session}/.task/IMPL-001.json
```

### How do I clean up old sessions?

```bash
# List sessions
/workflow:session:list

# Remove specific session
rm -rf .workflow/active/WFS-{session-id}

# Clean all completed sessions
/workflow:clean
```

## Best Practices

### What are the workflow best practices?

1. **Start simple** - Use the lowest level that meets your needs
2. **Plan before executing** - Use verification steps when available
3. **Test continuously** - Integrate testing into your workflow
4. **Review code** - Use built-in review workflows
5. **Document decisions** - Use brainstorm workflows for complex decisions

### When should I use worktree isolation?

**Worktree isolation** is primarily for **Issue Workflow**:
- After main development is complete
- Merged to `main` branch
- Issues discovered requiring fixes
- Need to fix without affecting current development

**Main Workflow** doesn't need worktree because:
- Dependency analysis solves parallelism
- Agents execute independent tasks in parallel
- No filesystem isolation needed
