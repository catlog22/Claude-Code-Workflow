## Workflow Selection

### How do I choose the right workflow?

<details>
<summary>Decision Framework</summary>

Use this quick decision tree:

1. **Post-development maintenance?** → Use [Issue Workflow](/en/workflows/faq#what-is-the-difference-between-main-workflow-and-issue-workflow)
2. **Uncertain which commands to use?** → Use `ccw-coordinator` (Level 5)
3. **Requirements unclear?** → Use `brainstorm:auto-parallel` (Level 4)
4. **Need persistent session?**
   - Standard development → `plan` → `execute` (Level 3)
   - Test-driven → `tdd-plan` → `execute` (Level 3)
   - Test fixes → `test-fix-gen` → `test-cycle-execute` (Level 3)
5. **Need multi-perspective analysis?** → Use `multi-cli-plan` (Level 2)
6. **Bug fix?** → Use `lite-fix` (Level 2)
7. **Need planning?** → Use `lite-plan` → `lite-execute` (Level 2)
8. **Quick task?** → Use `lite-lite-lite` (Level 1)

</details>

### What's the difference between Main Workflow and Issue Workflow?

<details>
<summary>Comparison</summary>

**Main Workflow** is for primary development:
- Feature development (Levels 1-5)
- Active development phase
- Dependency-based parallelism
- Works on current branch

**Issue Workflow** is for post-development maintenance:
- Bug fixes and enhancements after merge
- After main workflow completes
- Optional worktree isolation
- Keeps main branch stable

| Aspect | Main Workflow | Issue Workflow |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| **Purpose** | Feature development | Post-development fixes |
| **Timing** | Development phase | After main workflow completes |
| **Scope** | Complete feature implementation | Targeted fixes/enhancements |
| **Parallelism** | Dependency analysis | Worktree isolation (optional) |
| **Branch Model** | Work on current branch | Can use isolated worktree |

</details>

### What are Minimum Execution Units?

<details>
<summary>Explanation</summary>

**Minimum Execution Units** are sets of commands that must execute together as atomic groups to achieve meaningful workflow milestones. Splitting these commands breaks logical flow and creates incomplete states.

**Common Minimum Execution Units:**

| Unit | Commands | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| Quick Implementation | `lite-plan` → `lite-execute` | Lightweight plan and execution |
| Multi-CLI Planning | `multi-cli-plan` → `lite-execute` | Multi-perspective analysis and execution |
| Bug Fix | `lite-fix` → `lite-execute` | Bug diagnosis and fix execution |
| Verified Planning | `plan` → `plan-verify` → `execute` | Planning with verification and execution |
| TDD Planning | `tdd-plan` → `execute` | Test-driven development planning and execution |
| Test Validation | `test-fix-gen` → `test-cycle-execute` | Generate test tasks and execute test-fix cycle |

**Example**: The unit `lite-plan → lite-execute` must complete together. Stopping after `lite-plan` leaves you with a plan but no implementation.

</details>

### When should I use each workflow level?

<details>
<summary>Level Selection Guide</summary>

**Level 1 (lite-lite-lite):**
- Quick fixes (typos, minor adjustments)
- Simple features (single function, small utility)

# Level 4 - Brainstorming
ccw brainstorm:auto-parallel "Design notification system"

# Level 5 - Intelligent coordination
ccw ccw-coordinator "Refactor API layer"
```

</details>

### What is the difference between lite-execute and execute?

<details>
<summary>Comparison</summary>

**lite-execute** (Level 2):
```bash
ccw lite-execute --in-memory
```
- For Level 2 workflows
- In-memory planning (no session files)
- Parallel execution for independent tasks
- Optional code review

**execute** (Level 3):
```bash
ccw workflow:execute --session WFS-{session-id}
```
- For Level 3 workflows
- Session-based execution
- Dependency analysis
- Full state tracking and resumability
- Task completion summaries

</details>

### How do I use hotfix mode?

<details>
<summary>Hotfix Usage</summary>

**Hotfix mode** is for production emergencies:

```bash
ccw lite-fix --hotfix "Production database connection failing"
```

**What it does:**
- Skips most diagnosis phases
- Minimal planning (direct execution)
- Auto-generates follow-up tasks for complete fix + post-mortem

**When to use:**
- Production incidents
- Critical bugs requiring immediate fix
- Outages and service disruptions

**What happens after:**
CCW automatically generates follow-up tasks for:
- Complete root cause analysis
- Comprehensive fix
- Post-mortem documentation

</details>

### How do I resume a paused session?

<details>
<summary>Session Resume</summary>

```bash
# Resume most recent session
ccw workflow:session:resume

# Resume specific session
ccw workflow:session:resume WFS-user-auth-v2

# List all sessions
ccw workflow:session:list
```

**Session states:**
- **active**: Currently running
- **paused**: Stopped, can be resumed
- **completed**: Finished and archived

</details>

## AI Models

### Which AI models does CCW support?

<details>
<summary>Supported Models</summary>

CCW supports multiple AI models via CLI endpoints:

| Model | Capabilities | Best For |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| **Gemini** | Analysis + Write | Code review, debugging, refactoring |
| **Codex** | Analysis + Write + Review | Git-aware code review, implementation |
| **Claude** | Analysis + Write | Complex reasoning, documentation |
| **Qwen** | Analysis + Write | Code generation, pattern matching |

Configure models in `~/.claude/cli-tools.json`.

</details>

### How do I configure API keys?

<details>
<summary>API Key Configuration</summary>

**Set environment variables:**

```bash
# Gemini
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-key-here"

# OpenAI (Codex)
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key-here"

# Anthropic (Claude)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key-here"

# Qwen
export DASHSCOPE_API_KEY="your-key-here"
```

**Or configure in `.env` file:**
```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-key-here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key-here
DASHSCOPE_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

</details>

### What is multi-CLI collaboration?

<details>
<summary>Multi-CLI Explanation</summary>

**Multi-CLI collaboration** uses multiple AI models to analyze the same problem from different perspectives:

```bash
ccw multi-cli-plan "Compare Redis vs RabbitMQ for message queuing"
```

**How it works:**
1. Multiple AI models analyze independently
2. Each provides unique insights and recommendations
3. Results are synthesized into a comprehensive analysis
4. You get multiple perspectives before making decisions

**Best for:**
- Technology selection
- Architecture decisions
- Solution comparison
- Trade-off analysis

</details>

## Testing

### How do I add tests to existing code?

<details>
<summary>Test Generation</summary>

**Session Mode (from existing session):**
```bash
ccw test-fix-gen WFS-user-auth-v2
```

**Prompt Mode (direct description):**
```bash
ccw test-fix-gen "Add unit tests for the auth API"
```

**CCW will:**
1. Analyze the code structure
2. Generate appropriate test cases
3. Create test files following project patterns
4. Implement tests with proper assertions

</details>

### How do I fix failing tests?

<details>
<summary>Test Fix Workflow</summary>

```bash
# Generate test fix tasks
ccw test-fix-gen "Tests failing for user registration"

# Execute test-fix cycle
ccw test-cycle-execute
```

**Workflow:**
1. Analyze test failures
2. Identify root causes
3. Fix issues iteratively
4. Verify >= 95% pass rate
5. Stop when tests pass or max iterations reached

</details>

### What is TDD (Test-Driven Development)?

<details>
<summary>TDD Explanation</summary>

**TDD** follows the Red-Green-Refactor cycle:

1. **Red**: Write a failing test
2. **Green**: Write minimal code to pass the test
3. **Refactor**: Improve code while keeping tests green

**The Iron Law:**
```
NO PRODUCTION CODE WITHOUT A FAILING TEST FIRST
```

**Why write tests first?**

| Aspect | Test-First | Test-After |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| **Proof** | Tests fail before implementation | Tests pass immediately (proves nothing) |
| **Discovery** | Edge cases found before coding | Edge cases found after coding |
| **Verification** | Verifies requirements | Verifies implementation |

</details>

## Troubleshooting

### My workflow failed. What should I do?

<details>
<summary>Troubleshooting Steps</summary>

1. **Check the error message** - Identify the root cause
2. **Review session state** - Check `.workflow/.ccw-coordinator/{session}/state.json`
3. **Resume the session** - Use `ccw workflow:session:resume` to continue
4. **Adjust and retry** - Modify approach based on error

**Common fixes:**
- **API key errors**: Verify environment variables are set
- **Module not found**: Run `npm install` or `pip install`
- **Git errors**: Ensure clean git state (`git status`)
- **Timeout errors**: Increase timeout in task JSON

</details>

### How do I skip a failing task?

<details>
<summary>Skip Task</summary>

Edit the task JSON to set status to "completed":

```bash
jq '.status = "completed"' .workflow/active/WFS-{session}/.task/IMPL-001.json
```

**Use with caution:** Skipping tasks may leave the workflow in an incomplete state.

</details>

### How do I clean up old sessions?

<details>
<summary>Cleanup Commands</summary>

```bash
# List sessions
ccw workflow:session:list

# Remove specific session
rm -rf .workflow/active/WFS-{session-id}

# Clean all completed sessions
ccw workflow:clean
```

**Automatic cleanup:**
- Completed sessions are archived to `.workflow/completed/`
- Old sessions (> 30 days) can be safely removed

</details>

### Why is my workflow running slowly?

<details>
<summary>Performance Tips</summary>

**Possible causes:**

1. **Large codebase**: CCW analyzes the entire project
   - **Fix**: Use `--focus-paths` to limit analysis scope

2. **Many dependencies**: Slow AI response times
   - **Fix**: Use faster models (Gemini Flash) for initial analysis

3. **Sequential tasks**: Waiting on dependent tasks
   - **Fix**: Review task dependencies in `plan-verify`

4. **Network issues**: Slow API calls to AI services
   - **Fix**: Check network connectivity and API status

**Optimization tips:**
```bash
# Limit analysis scope
ccw plan "Add login" --focus-paths src/auth

# Use faster model for initial analysis
ccw cli -p "Quick analysis" --model gemini-2.0-flash --mode analysis

# Run in parallel when possible
ccw workflow:execute --parallel 4
```

</details>

### How do I debug workflow issues?

<details>
<summary>Debugging Workflow</summary>

**Enable debug logging:**
```bash
DEBUG=ccw:* ccw workflow:plan "My feature"
```

**Check session logs:**
```bash
# View session state
cat .workflow/active/WFS-{session}/workflow-session.json

# View task progress
cat .workflow/active/WFS-{session}/TODO_LIST.md
```

**Use debug workflow:**
```bash
ccw workflow:debug-with-file "Debug memory leak in connection handler"
```

This provides hypothesis-driven debugging with documented exploration.

</details>

## Integration

### Can I use CCW with my existing CI/CD?

<details>
<summary>CI/CD Integration</summary>

Yes, CCW can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines:

**GitHub Actions Example:**
```yaml
- name: Run CCW Workflow
  run: |
    ccw workflow:plan "Implement feature"
    ccw workflow:execute --session WFS-feature
  env:
    GEMINI_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.GEMINI_API_KEY }}
```

**Best practices:**
- Use `--mode analysis` for code review in CI
- Store API keys in secret management
- Run workflows in isolated environments
- Archive sessions for audit trails

</details>

### Can CCW work with monorepos?

<details>
<summary>Monorepo Support</summary>

Yes, CCW supports monorepos:

**Workspace-aware execution:**
```bash
# Execute in specific package
ccw plan "Add auth to frontend" --cd packages/frontend

# Execute across packages
ccw plan "Update API contracts" --include-dir packages/api,packages/shared
```

**Benefits:**
- Dependency-aware task distribution
- Parallel execution across packages
- Shared session state
- Coordinated changes across workspaces

</details>

### How do I migrate from another tool?

<details>
<summary>Migration Guide</summary>

**From basic Git workflows:**
```bash
# Before: Manual planning
git checkout -b feature
# ... manual planning ...

# After: CCW planning
ccw plan "Add feature"
ccw execute --session WFS-feature
```

**From other AI tools:**
- CCW provides structured workflows (vs. ad-hoc prompts)
- Session management (vs. chat history)
- Multi-agent coordination (vs. single AI)
- Persistent artifacts (vs. transient responses)

**Migration steps:**
